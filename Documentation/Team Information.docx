Technology Stack and Justification

Program language: Java
Programming platform: IntelliJ IDEA CE
UI design: Figma
APIs: We have not finalized the APIs technologies we would use. Here is the list of APIs we are considering:
Java2D, Swing, SDLJAva.
We are also considering creating our private APIs from Amazon API Gateway, because our 9MM app is built locally on our computer. Private API can help increase collaboration between team member, using the available resources. For example: the "computer player" can make use of available game play to match with the player.
